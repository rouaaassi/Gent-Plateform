- Recover automatically from failures
- Update without downtime
- Optimize resource utilization

### Microservices Architecture
Break monoliths into manageable services:
- Independent deployment cycles
- Technology diversity
- Isolated failure domains
- Team autonomy

### Containerization
Package applications consistently:
- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- Consistent environments
- Resource efficiency

## Infrastructure as Code

Manage infrastructure programmatically:
- Version-controlled infrastructure
- Reproducible environments
- Automated provisioning
- Compliance as code

## Observability and Monitoring

Understand system behavior:
- Distributed tracing
- Centralized logging
- Metrics collection
- Real-time alerting

## Best Practices

1. **Design for Failure**: Assume components will fail
2. **Automate Everything**: Reduce manual intervention
3. **Optimize Costs**: Monitor and adjust resource usage
